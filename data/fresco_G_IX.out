0Centre-of-mass Range is    302 * 0.1000 fm., Maximum at  30.00 fm., Interpolating NL forms every  0.40 fm.
0Non - locality width is      4 * 0.1000 fm., Maximum of   0.30 fm., Centred at  0.00 fm.
02-Nucleon Separation of      0 * 0.4000 fm., Maximum of   0.00 fm., Minimum at  0.00 fm.
0Maximum single particle bins of 30.0000 fm.

0Range of total J is     0.0 <= J <=    50.0 and Absorbtion =>     0.0010 mb.
 Dry Run = F, CC set limits =  0  0, Relativistic kinematics =  , Both/Far/Near Analyses =  1

0Cross Sections (and up to T0 for 0=projectile) for Theta from   0.0 to  60.0 in steps of  1.0 degrees.  Coordinates = 0 (Mads)
0  Lower Radial Cutoff = maximum of -1.60*L*h &       0.0 fm.,  Lower Cutoff for Couplings =   0.0  fm.

0Iterate Couplings between   1 and   1 times, to  0.000 % if sooner.                                          
  Block solved exactly =   1 chs., with Pade = 0 & Isocen = 0=0, NOSOL = F
  NL quadrature with   36 Gaussian points, Calculate multipoles up to    56 from   0
  M-transfers for lp+lt greater than or equal to  6, Angular Integration Cutoff below  0.6944 %

0Trace switches are :  CHANS =  1, LISTCC =  1, TRENEG =  0, CDETR =  0, SMATS =  2, XSTABL =  1, NLPL =  0

                       WAVES =  0, LAMPL =  0, VEFF =  0, KFUS =  0, WDISK =  0, BPM =  0, MELFIL =  0

                       CDCC =  0, NFUS =  0

 Using unit mass = 1.000000 amu and 1/fine-structure constant = 137.03599 ( 1.000000 * true ) with hc = 197.32705 MeV.fm,
  thus 2*amu/hbar^2 = 0.0478450 = 1/20.9008 and Coulomb constant = 0.1574855 so e^2 = 1.43997

 Now pre-scan input and save to file 3
